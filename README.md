Wow, okay... my head is still kind of buzzing from Deva. I’m sitting here with crumbs all over, and my back is, ouch, super stiff. There were these kids kicking the back of my seat the whole time but, you know, worth it maybe? 

Deva sort of... went all in. Like, all chips on the table and somehow, they pulled a rabbit out of a toaster, not a hat! The opening scene is like — BAM! — full color explosion and I spill popcorn everywhere, like in my lap and the floor becomes a crunchy carpet. 

And Deva... her eyes!! Felt like she could see through the screen, like into the back of my skull, you know? Like when you forgot to defrost chicken and you're hoping the microwave does the magic. 

> There was this scene, oh my god, with the butterflies. Or were those just my eyes going funny from too much flickering light? Either way, butterflies or no, my heart was doing somersaults. McDreamy guy, what’s-his-name, had that brooding look like my husband Jeff when I told him to download the movie and he thought I meant right that second.

Was it the movie or the stale candy I found at the bottom of my handbag making me feel all... twisty inside? Felt like an old washing machine, the ones that take forever but they’re just so reliable you don't want to kick them.

I could smell someone's jacket that had been dry-cleaned with that lemony stuff and the air was filled with quiet munching and muted burps, classics at theaters, right? Got me wondering if I should just go back for a second watch the movie or just casually mention it when people ask why I’m all starry-eyed.

Then they did this twist (plot twist? plot shake? plot earthquake more like it!) and I just sat there, empty popcorn bucket on the floor, probably looking like my pet rabbit when he hears the fridge opening. Such pure wonder or confusion – maybe both.

But hey, I probably shouldn’t forget about the way the ending kind of glued the whole shebang together. Or unraveled it like that one sweater I had in high school, where one loose thread and bam, oh boy.

```csharp
//What the heck did I do here..?
void DevaThoughtProcess()
{
    try
    {
        int popcornCrunchLevel = unexpectedTwists + emotionalOverload;
        float satisfactionIndex = math.Sqrt(flyingPopcorn);
    }
    catch (MindBlownException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Wow, too much, back to Earth. Process Later.);
    }
}
```
